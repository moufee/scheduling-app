# PHP OAuth Extension Example

This example uses the OAuth PECL extension. More info can be found here at (php.net)[http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.oauth.php].

## Setup

Set your consumer key, consumer secret and callback url in `oauth_config.php`. (You can get a consumer key and secret by emailing (support)[mailto:support@plannincenteronline.com].) The callback url should be a full url (not just a path) to the location of the code in `callback.php`.

Now visit `index.php`. Tada!
